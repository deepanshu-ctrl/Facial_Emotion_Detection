# Facial_Emotion_Detection
This project employs the deepface library and OpenCV to perform real-time facial emotion detection. It utilizes the webcam to capture video, identifies faces within the frames, and makes predictions about the emotions exhibited by each detected face. The identified emotion labels are then promptly displayed on the frames in real-time.
